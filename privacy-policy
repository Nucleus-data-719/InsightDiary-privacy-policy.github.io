1. Introduction
Welcome to InsightDiary. We are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains our practices regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of information when you use our mobile application (the "App").
The Core Principle: InsightDiary is designed with privacy as its foundation. All your data—including journal entries, photos, documents, habits, tasks, and AI-generated insights—is processed exclusively on your personal device. No personal data is transmitted to our servers or any third-party servers.

2. Information We Collect
Because InsightDiary operates offline, we do not collect, store, or transmit your personal data to external servers. All data resides solely on your device.
The App may request access to the following on your device to provide its features:
Camera: To allow you to take picture and scan documents, where text is extracted for your personal use within the App.
Notifications: To send you reminders for habits and tasks, if you choose to set them.

3. How We Use Your Information (On-Device Processing)
All processing occurs locally on your device:

AI Insights & Analysis: The AI that provides insights into your writing, mood patterns, or "best days" runs completely on your device. Your journal entries are never sent to us or any AI service provider.
Document Scanning: Text extraction from scanned documents is performed on-device. The document images and extracted text remain on your device.
App Functionality: To enable core features like saving journal entries, tracking habits, managing your tasks, and displaying daily quotes (which are bundled within the App).
Reminders: To manage and trigger local notifications for your habits and tasks.

4. Data Sharing and Disclosure
We do not share, sell, rent, or trade your personal data with any third parties because we do not collect it.

Third-Party Services:
App Stores: Any interaction with Apple's App Store or Google Play Store is governed by their respective privacy policies. We do not receive any personal data about you from them unless you voluntarily contact us via a channel linked to the store (e.g., support email).
Export Function: When you use the "Export" feature, data is prepared on your device and shared via your device's standard sharing menu. This transfer is governed by the privacy policy of the service you choose to use for the export.

5. Data Security
Your data's security is tied to the security of your own device. We encourage you to use device-level security features like passcodes, biometric locks, and regular backups.

6. Data Retention & Deletion
Retention: Your data persists on your device for as long as you have the App installed, or until you manually delete entries/habits/tasks within the App.
Deletion: You can delete any individual piece of content at any time within the App. Uninstalling the App will remove all associated data from your device. We do not have a copy of this data. Please ensure you have exported any data you wish to keep before uninstalling.

7. Your Rights
Since your data is stored locally, you have full control over it. You can access, correct, or delete your data directly within the InsightDiary App.

8. Children's Privacy
InsightDiary is not directed at children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. As all data is stored locally, parents or guardians should be aware of this and supervise device usage.

9. Changes to This Privacy Policy
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy in the App Store listing and within the App's update notes. You are advised to review this policy periodically.
